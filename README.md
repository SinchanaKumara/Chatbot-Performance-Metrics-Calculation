# Chatbot-Performance-Metrics-Calculation

1. Introduction
In this report, we evaluate the performance of a RAG-based chatbot with a specific focus on the metrics of Context Precision and Context Recall. These metrics are crucial in understanding how accurately and comprehensively the chatbot retrieves and utilizes relevant context in its responses.
2. Methodology
Context Precision:
•	Definition: Context Precision measures the proportion of relevant context pieces correctly retrieved by the chatbot from the total number of context pieces retrieved.
•	Calculation Method: Context Precision=Number of Relevant Context Pieces RetrievedTotal Number of Context Pieces Retrieved\ text {Context Precision} = \frac{\text{Number of Relevant Context Pieces Retrieved}}{\text{Total Number of Context Pieces Retrieved}}Context Precision=Total Number of Context Pieces RetrievedNumber of Relevant Context Pieces Retrieved
•	Tools/Techniques: Used Python with libraries such as scikit-learn for precision calculation.
Context Recall:
•	Definition: Context Recall measures the proportion of relevant context pieces correctly retrieved by the chatbot from the total number of relevant context pieces available.
•	Calculation Method: Context Recall=Number of Relevant Context Pieces RetrievedTotal Number of Relevant Context Pieces Available\text{Context Recall} = \frac{\text{Number of Relevant Context Pieces Retrieved}}{\text{Total Number of Relevant Context Pieces Available}}Context Recall=Total Number of Relevant Context Pieces AvailableNumber of Relevant Context Pieces Retrieved
•	Tools/Techniques: Used Python with libraries such as scikit-learn for recall calculation.

3. Improvements Implemented
To improve Context Precision and Context Recall, the following methods were proposed and implemented:
Method 1: Enhanced Retrieval Algorithm:
•	Explanation: Implemented a more sophisticated retrieval algorithm that uses a combination of keyword matching and semantic similarity.
•	Implementation: Integrated the new algorithm into the chatbot's retrieval process.
•	Expected Impact: Increased both precision and recall by retrieving more relevant context pieces.
Method 2: Context Filtering:
•	Explanation: Introduced a filtering mechanism to remove irrelevant context pieces before they are used in generating responses.
•	Implementation: Applied a filtering layer based on contextual relevance scores.
•	Expected Impact: Improved precision by ensuring only the most relevant context pieces are considered.

4. Challenges and Solutions
Challenge 1: Balancing Precision and Recall:
•	Issue: Improving precision sometimes led to a decrease in recall and vice versa.
•	Solution: Fine-tuned the retrieval algorithm and filtering mechanism to find an optimal balance between precision and recall.
Challenge 2: Computational Efficiency:
•	Issue: Enhanced algorithms increased computational load.
•	Solution: Optimized the code and utilized efficient data structures to maintain performance.

5. Conclusion
This report presented the evaluation of Context Precision and Context Recall for a RAG-based chatbot. The implementation of an enhanced retrieval algorithm and context filtering mechanism significantly improved both metrics, leading to a more accurate and comprehensive retrieval of relevant context.
